# Predict-ICU-Length-of-Stay

This project is a group final project for BIS 550 : Topics in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Yale University. 


## Project Intro/Objective
The objective of the project was to select a dataset of interest and apply the computational methods learned in class. The dataset was from the MIMIC2 Original ICU Database downloaed from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). We created a database and extracted relevent features for analysis. We build four machine learning models (Elastic Net Regression, Regression Tree, Random Forest Regression, Artifical Neural Networks) to identify key risk factors of ICU stay. We look 12 explanatory variables (clinical and demographic) and 2 outcome variables (length stay and length of stay group) of 2,234 patient records.
